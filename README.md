# Homebrew Karaoke

A karaoke system that uses Deep Learning Models to get lyrics and pitch of any vocal songs.\
Still in very early prototyping stage. Intended to be used with my [Audio-Processing-Toolkit](https://github.com/August13742/Audio-Processing-Utilities) (with in-app communication)

Pitch detection &scoring works but needs a lot of tweaking.

currently full of hard-coded paths and bugs (such as pitch note audio desync, pitch detection being too strict, etc.)

A lot of the code is written by LLM.
